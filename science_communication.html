                Our team chalked out a beautiful plan for science communication since the very beginning of the project. We interacted with people from different walks of life for this purpose. Our science communication was spread across students and the general public both.

            <p>
                Before Covid-19 emergency was declared, our team had a great opportunity to connect with a wide audience through decorated platforms and showcase our project with like-minded scientific community. Our team presented our project still in its ideation stage at the Department of Biology, Ram Lal Anand College, Delhi University, New Delhi, India. The college organised a DBT sponsored national seminar on ‘Metagenomics and Genome Editing’ with students across the country to showcase their ideas and projects in the related fields. We met teams with innovative ideas and projects working across domains of healthcare, environment, smarthealth, and microbiology keeping in mind problems faced by masses in the country.Our team stood First in the competition and was rewarded with a cash prize.

           <p>
            As much it was important to share our idea and concept to the scientific community, bringing out an idea in the public domain amidst people from different industries and the viewpoints of industry experts was equally significant in deriving proposed implementation and practical feasibility of the idea. To gain more insight we participated in ‘Youth jalsa’ an idea pitching event part of International Conference on Environmental Challenges and Solutions. Our team was selected among the five teams which were then funded for 2.5 Lacs INR (3,377.62 USD) each to build the prototype and examine practical feasibility of the idea.

<p>
    While addressing audiences from varied backgrounds, our team received a lot of questions pertaining to synthetic biology, the basics behind it and most importantly business opportunities in the coming decade in this sector. 

</p>

<h2 style="padding-top:120px"><u>Li-Koff Comic Special:</u></h2>
<p>
    To help create an open dialogue across students, researchers, teachers and the general public, we released an animated Comic book and disseminated it digitally and in person to help people understand the know-how of synthetic biology. The comic was also released in Hindi Language (National Language of India) to maximise its reach. The comic was designed in such a way that the basic concept is understood by all. It was designed both in English and Hindi so that we can maximise its reach. We got amazing feedback for our comic.

    Every year Government of India Sponsors 5 teams (Collegiate and Community labs) to participate in iGEM. This is known as iBEC( indian biological engineering competition) or pre-iGEM. Our team managed to bag a spot in top 5 selected by the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India. The news was circulated in various print media. 

</p>
<p>
    Our team’s feat at youth jalsa was also covered by Times of India; a leading newspaper in India to commemorate the ideas selected by panel of judges in wake of bringing innovative solutions to solve mundane problems of Urban India. Our team was felicitated by the Chief Minister of Haryana( state of India) at the occasion.

 We took the opportunity of having the lockdown erased in the country and interacted with the general public.

</p>
<p>
    Our team members showed their creative art skills and painted the planters with our team name, logo and iGEM logo and basic information about our project. Environment was kept in mind while showing creativity. This was done by taking earthen planters and using eco friendly colors. Anybody can understand the overview of our project by looking at these planters. The next task was to get Peace Lily plants for these planters. Peace lily was specifically chosen as it can reduce Nitrogen pollution. A total of 15 planters were designed. The next goal was to distribute these planters. For this we chose LAJPAT NAGAR, a famous shopping area in Delhi NCR, a shopping hub of fast fashion and low priced consumer goods of daily domestic needs. We connected with random people in the market place and explained our project. As a symbol of taking part in our hearsay, people were presented with a planter. We met people from different age group and occupations. It was an amazing experience. People showed high interest in knowing our project. We also gained a lot of appreciation for our creativity. The entire event took a day but the preparations began a week before. This form of event instilled new zeal in our team members and made us work more zealously.

  <p>
    Many times it is seen that only the privileged students get a chance to know new things. They are provided with good opportunities. We are completely against this norm. Therefore, we collaborated with Robin Hood. Robin Hood is an NGO  in India which provides free education to underprivileged students. We went to the various clusters of the NGO in Vasant Kunj, New Delhi, India. We had an amazing session with the students. We taught basic biological things such as what is a cell, structural organisation in the human body, difference between plant cell and animal cell and many more. We also played various games with the kids. The kids were also taught about hygiene by demonstrating them the proper way of washing hands. We also distributed our comics to these students.The students were so happy to learn new things. We would definitely like to conduct more sessions with them.

    WEBINARS
  </h2>
  <p>
    Environment is the most precious thing that human life owns. It is our prime responsibility to protect our environment beautifully. Since our project is an environment based project and environment belongs to each one of us therefore, we conducted two different series of webinars:

  </p>

<ol class='a'>
    <li>
        <b>Bio Building Blocks:</b> This series of webinars was conducted with school students to tell them about iGEM, Synthetic Biology and our project. Through these webinars we interacted with a large number of students and could spread a word about Synthetic Biology. 

    </li><br></br>
    <li>
        <b>Saving Environment Through Innovation:</b>Under this umbrella we connected with students other than those from life science background. These webinars were  a great way in throwing light on ‘Environment Consciousness’.

<p>
    This session has a special place in our heart. During this session we communicated with government school students.The students were amazed to know about Synthetic Biology. We also enthusiastically told the students about iGEM. Thrilled to know about our project and synbio they asked us about the various sources of learning synthetic Biology. The zest of the students to learn synbio led to curation of synbio 101 ( our synbio video series).

    We were highly excited for this collaboration as it was with our mentor team: IISER Tirupati. We thought of cumulatively working on our mission to spread a word about Synthetic Biology through ‘Bio Building Blocks’ along with
 IISER Tirupati.</p> <p>
     The webinar was conducted with students aged 14 to 16 year olds. The students were taught about Synthetic Biology, iGEM, synthetic biology tools and projects of both the teams. The students were encouraged to participate in iGEM and take biology courses further. The students asked various questions about our project. 

 </p>
 <p>
    The best part of this webinar was to introduce synthetic biology to young minds of today as they are going to be our tomorrow.

    We connected with team MSP through our instagram page in September. It  started with having a virtual discussion about each other's project. After the discussion both the teams were glad to know that both of their projects are involved in solving environmental issues. With subsequent meet-ups and brainstorming sessions both the teams decided to go for a webinar with students in the age group of 8- 10 years. We chose the topic of the webinar to be ‘environment consciousness’ as we believe that environment consciousness is something which has to be inculcated in a person since childhood. Both the teams conducted meet-ups and discussed the presentation content  for the webinar.
The webinar was conducted with students of Manav Rachna International School Faridabad, National Capital Region, India. More than 100 students participated and were presented varied ways through which one can protect the environment. Both the teams discussed their project idea in an interactive manner for the kids. A survey was conducted before the webinar and after the webinar to understand their level of environment consciousness and the impact of the webinar.

<p>
    The students gave innovative solutions to save the environment.
